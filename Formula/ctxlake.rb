# Homebrew formula TEMPLATE for ctxlake.
#
# This is not consumed by Homebrew directly — it is filled in by
# `packaging/render-formula.sh` (called from .github/workflows/release.yml's
# `release` job, after the four target archives and their checksums exist) and
# the *rendered* file is attached to the GitHub Release as `ctxlake.rb`.
#
# OxidantData/homebrew-tap pulls that asset itself, hourly, via its own
# `sync-formulae` workflow — the tap writes only to itself and reads only public
# releases, so nothing here needs a token scoped to another repo.
#
# This used to say the copy was a manual step, "deliberately", on the reasoning
# that a cross-repo push token outweighed saving one `cp`. The reasoning was fine
# and the outcome was not: the `cp` never happened for any release, so
# `brew install oxidantdata/tap/ctxlake` failed for every user while the docs
# advertised it. A documented step nobody runs is worse than an automated one,
# because everyone downstream assumes it ran.
#
# Shape matches ../../homebrew-tap/Formula/oxidant.rb (the house style: one
# `if OS.mac? / if Hardware::CPU.arm?` branch per platform+arch, not a loop) —
# ctxlake ships two binaries per archive (`ctxlake`, `ctxlake-hook`) where
# Oxidant ships one, so `install` lists both.
